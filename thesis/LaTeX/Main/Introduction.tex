\subsection{Aims and Objectives}
The main objective of this paper is to perform a survey on some applications of statistics in cybersecurity.

In particular: in \hyperref[chap:risk_management]{Chapter \ref*{chap:risk_management}} the risk management process is described and a Monte Carlo Method-based approach for evaluating information security investments is examined; in \hyperref[chap:IDS]{Chapter \ref*{chap:IDS}} the IDS systems are introduced and, above all, statistics-based techniques for developing these systems are briefly explained.

Lastly, in \hyperref[chap:conclusions]{Chapter \ref*{chap:conclusions}} some considerations are made and conclusions are drawn.

Actually, this paper is rather a survey than a proper innovative research paper: indeed, most of the results presented below have been excerpted from several papers published within the last three decades.

The references to these latter can be found in \hyperref[references]{Chapter 5}.
